# WiD-Datathon 2022

According to the World Economic Forum’s most recent Global Gender Gap Report, the gender gaps in the workforce are an emerging crisis.
In 2022, 129 countries reported a reduction of women’s labour-force participation relative to men's.
There are also gaps in pay, leadership roles, professional and skill development, and even gaps in stress levels.

We're exploring unequal pay and our focus is on what's missing in published reports on the topic

Datasets used:
- Kaggle gender paygap data
- Reddit data with conversations women had regarding salary negotiations
- Everyday sexism forum data with conversations women had regarding their experience of sexism in the workplace

Findings:
- Men and women have similar pay when their educational levels and seniority at work are the same 
- Women don't rise to seniority in the workplace because they leave due to discomfort at work
